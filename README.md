# Micro Patterns

*Micro patterns* are well-defined code structures that can be automatically detected by a tool. They were first described in an [OOPSLA 2005](http://www.oopsla.org/2005/ShowPage.do?id=Home) paper titled "[Micro Patterns in Java Code](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~imaman/stuff/ip-oopsla05-c.pdf)" (by Yossi Gil and Itay Maman). The code here is the original micro-patterns detector used for the research work described in that paper.
